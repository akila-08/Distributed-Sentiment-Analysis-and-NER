            "|GUM_vlog_exams.txt    |Neuroscience finals . Hi ! Good morning , it is Monday May 3rd 10:38 a.m. I have a meeting at 10:45 so in a few minutes with one of my TFs about my project . I'm I 'm gonna gon na meet with her quickly and see if she has any feedback and then I'll I 'll be working on chem and neuro . She's She 's not here yet . Hi ! I'm I 'm so sorry , I went to the section link . I was waiting there , I was like \" uhm , did I get the time wrong ? \" But okay , this makes a lot more sense . My hair is in a bun . I took a shower . I should let it dry but I'm I 'm too lazy to take it out . It's It 's a new day , a little rainy outside . But I actually like when it's it 's gloomy for studying because then I feel like there's there 's nothing else you could be doing , so you might as well just stay inside and work . So I have some coffee and I'll I 'll be focusing entirely on chem and neuro today , I think . Full day of studying , not really much to update you all on . Hello ! It is 2:25 a.m. I've I 've just been studying for neuroscience , my neuro exam . It's It 's currently 2:25 a.m. on Wednesday . It's It 's raining . I've I 've been doing a semi - Pomodoro technique but I've I 've been doing like working from like half an hour to an hour and then taking like 10 minute breaks . I do it based off of what I'm I 'm trying to get done because I have my neuroscience final study schedule . These are the things I've I 've gotten done , so I got this done , got this done , got this done . I'm I 'm currently working on this and then I'll I 'll try to get to this , but if I can't ca n't then I can do it tomorrow . Just wanted to show you . This is realistic . I'm I 'm up very late so I wanted to show that , finals as a college student , you know . So I'm I 'm going to do what I can and then maybe finish like one or two more lectures and then I will start taking a look at chem . I will be up for a little while longer . Hi Kat ! A lot of the notes that I had taken from our last meeting and being more of a cause or like leading to memory's memory 's importance for each of the sources , I — I essentially changed it to um \" it's it 's the one persistent element of our existence that gives meaning to the inheritance of memory \" . How do we remember ? I asked this not only as a question of the methods , but also of the circumstances . Oh my god , I'm I 'm so tired . I accidentally posted a video I meant to schedule . So now I have to post about it . I like deleted Instagram and like wasn't was n't really checking social media too much this week , but now I have to redownload it , so I can post about it . Finals ! Hello ! It is May 7th Friday May 7th the day of my final , currently 9:46 a.m. I'm I 'm going to be taking it at 10 a.m. , so I have 15 minutes . The reason I'm I 'm taking it like this early is because I have my med school class at two to four thirty , so we have three hours 45 minutes to take it . I'm I 'm gonna gon na take it at ten , so I can finish around like 1:45 in time for my class . I'm I 'm nervous . I'm I 'm really nervous . I don't do n't feel too great about it , but I'm I 'm going to be kind to myself with this . It was a really weird tiring semester , I think , relatively , compared to last semester , so you know , it is what it is . I'll I 'll try my best and am just gonna gon na take the test , move on , it's it 's just one more test . Wish me luck ! Hello ! Hi ! How are you ? Watching BTS . That's That 's lovely . Hi guys ! I finished my neuroscience exam a little bit after noon . It is now two o'clock and today is my friend Megumi's Megumi 's birthday . If you know Megumi then you'll you 'll know that she is one of my best friends . She also surprised me on my birthday , so now it's it 's my turn . I'm I 'm going to be ordering some donuts to pick up and then head over to her house and surprise her . Let's Let 's see . Honey - glazed . Okay , perfect . Okay , it's it 's a 16 minute walk . I will now head over . Hello ! Well , that's that 's exciting ! Really ? But you should come outside ! Oh , well , I think you should check your front door . What ? Who , me ? Not at all , I just think it's it 's really nice outside . Oh my god ! Hi ! Happy birthday ! Thank you ! Here you go ! And some tulips ! What the heck ? We gonna gon na hug .

            "|GUM_fiction_giants.txt|The Valley of Giants I had buried my parents in their gray marble mausoleum at the heart of the city . I had buried my husband in a lead box sunk into the mud of the bottom of the river , where all the riverboatmen lie . And after the war , I had buried my children , all four , in white linen shrouds in the new graveyards plowed into what used to be our farmland : all the land stretching from the river delta to the hills . I had one granddaughter who survived the war . I saw her sometimes : in a bright pink dress , a sparkling drink in her hand , on the arm of some foreign officer with brocade on his shoulders , at the edge of a marble patio . She never looked back at me — poverty and failure and political disrepute being all , these days , contagious and synonymous . The young were mostly dead , and the old men had been taken away , they told us , to learn important new things and to come back when they were ready to contribute fully . So it was a city of grandmothers . And it was in a grandmother bar by the waterfront — sipping hot tea with rum and watching over the shoulders of dockworkers playing mah - jongg — that I first heard of the valley of giants . We all laughed at the idea , except for a chemist with a crooked nose and rouge caked in the creases of her face , who was incensed . “ We live in the modern era ! ” she cried . “ You should be ashamed of yourself ! \" The traveler stood up from the table . She was bony and rough - skinned and bent like an old crow , with a blue silk scarf and hanks of hair as black as soot . Her eyes were veined with red . “ Nonetheless , ” the traveler said , and she walked out . They were laughing at the chemist as well as at the traveler . To find anyone still proud , anyone who believed in giants or shame , was hilarious . The air of the bar was acrid with triumph . Finding someone even more vulnerable and foolish than we were , after everything had been taken from us — that was a delight . But I followed the traveler , into the wet streets . The smell of fish oozed from the docks . Here and there were bits of charred debris in the gutters . I caught her at her door . She invited me in for tea and massage . Her limbs were weathered and ringed , like the branches of trees in the dry country . She smelled like honey that has been kept a while in a dark room , a little fermented . A heady smell . In the morning , brilliant sunlight scoured the walls and the floor , and the traveler and her pack were gone . I hurried home . My house had survived the war with all its brown clay walls intact , though the garden and the courtyard were a heap of blackened rubble . My house was empty and cold . I packed six loaves of flatbread , some olives , a hard cheese , one nice dress , walking clothes , my pills and glasses , a jug of wine , a can-teen of water , and a kitchen knife . I sat in the shadow in my living room for a while , looking at the amorphous mass of the blanket I had been crocheting . That granddaughter : her parents both worked in the vineyards , and when she was a child , she would play in my courtyard in the after - noons . When she scraped her knees bloody on the stones , she refused to cry . She would cry from frustration when the older children could do something that she couldn't could n't — like tie knots , or catch a chicken .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",
            "|GUM_speech_albania.txt|It is my special pleasure to address the fifty - ninth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations . This universal forum has enabled the peoples of the world to coordinate and harmonize their efforts in preserving peace and security , in achieving prosperity and upholding the values of human civilization . I would like to congratulate you , Mr. President , on being elected to preside over this august body and to express my confidence in your successful leadership . I would also like , on behalf of Albania , to convey to the Secretary - General our highest appreciation for his leading contribution to the fulfilment of the historical mission of the United Nations and to the aspirations of our peoples for a better world in which only peace , democracy and economic prosperity reign . This session of the General Assembly takes place in a milestone year for Europe . Only a few months ago , a historic event vitalized the dream of a more united and stronger Europe . Ten European countries , sharing a common aspiration for integration , were admitted into the European Union . The Albanian Government and society are engaged in an all - round European integration process , and they are carrying out necessary reforms with the necessary political will and drive . Albania is working to strengthen the democratic institutions and capacities of its central and local government with a view to bringing its legislation and conditions into line with European Union standards , progressively achieving concrete and measurable results , as previously defined . Determined to make our contribution to regional and global security , the Albanian Government considers the country's country 's integration into NATO to be one of its major objectives . The NATO Istanbul Summit last June commended the progress made by my country in this regard and encouraged the deepening of reforms . It welcomed Albania's Albania 's contribution to regional stability and cooperation and committed to assess our further progress at the next NATO summit , which would hopefully mark the start of negotiations for our full membership in the alliance . We believe that the commitments set up in the framework of the Adriatic Charter are also contributing to meet NATO standards , to the benefit of regional stability and security . We remain truly convinced that the respect and protection of human rights and freedoms are the main pillars of a pluralist democratic society . The Government of the Republic of Albania will continue to constantly demonstrate its commitment to a full implementation of the standards enshrined in the United Nations and Council of Europe conventions , as well as the relevant documents of regional organizations , such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , in which we are playing a very active role . We will continue to do so in the future as well . By adopting contemporary legislation and by becoming a party to other recently adopted international instruments on human rights , Albania has associated itself with countries that are enforcing a number of national strategies and programmes focusing on specific population groups , especially women , children , persons in need and minorities , among others . In recent years , the Albanian Government has started to periodically submit reports to the committees of the six main United Nations human rights treaties and is taking their recommendations into serious consideration . It is our belief that these international mechanisms play a significant and important role as guardians of the common human values we have together adopted . Albania , as one of the 191 signatory countries of the Millennium Declaration , remains fully committed to implementation of the Millennium Development Goals , which have been properly reflected in a national strategy for social and economic development . The pattern of our sustained economic growth , which is at 6 to 7 per cent for the seventh consecutive year , is a good support base for the whole society to maintain higher standards of respect for human rights and to fight poverty and crime . I would like to take this opportunity to thank the United Nations specialized agencies for their valuable assistance in support of the implementation of these objectives nationwide and on a central and local level . The Albanian Government is pleased to note that an ever - healthier climate of confidence and relations of bilateral and multilateral cooperation are prevailing in the South - Eastern European region . The countries of the region are fully engaged in a process that will lead us clearly toward Euro - Atlantic integration and at the same time continually remove us from the extremist tendencies that caused a number of conflicts in the last decade . The regional policy of my Government is guided by the motto : ' the more integrated in the region , the more integrated in Europe . ' In implementing this policy , Albania is cooperating as never before with all the countries of the region by making borders less relevant , opening up to one regional market the implementation of free trade agreements and free movement corridors , and stimulating foreign direct investment . We are especially cooperating with the common fight against organized crime and all kinds of illegal trafficking . In the meantime , Albania is reinforcing its border management and control , guided by the European Union and NATO standards . My country will hold general parliamentary elections by the middle of next year . We are committed to doing all that is required to ensure that the election process is fully compatible with international standards for free and fair elections . To that end , we are committed to continuing to work with relevant specialized institutions on elections by fully implementing especially OSCE / Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights ( ODIHR ) recommendations . For us , the process and standards are more important than the results of the elections . In the context of strengthening regional cooperation , my country is committed to a more enhanced partnership with all regional organizations and initiatives that serve the promotion of good neighbourly relations ; the strengthening of regional peace , security and stability ; ensuring political support for integration into Euro - Atlantic structures , and attracting financing for national and regional projects in priority fields such as energy , transportation and telecommunications . On its path towards European integration , the South - East European region is still facing pending challenges , such as the future of Kosovo . Albania greatly appreciates the recent democratic and integration developments in Kosovo , thanks to the efforts of the respective peoples and the partnership of its self - governing institutions with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo ( UNMIK ) . Allow me at this point to congratulate Mr. Soren Jessen - Petersen , Special Representative for Kosovo of the United Nations Secretary - General , in assuming this very important duty .|\n",
            "|GUM_court_equality.txt|Dr. Guruswamy . My Lords , thank you . My Lord the Chief Justice may recognize , my Lords , that the Hindu Marriage Act is not an issue necessarily of personal law : it is statutory law . And we will demonstrate that . The terms of the Constitution , the reform of the Hindu Marriage Act , has always been in the context of statutory law . So , my Lords , to that extent and that extent only in the context of statutory law and making statutory law workable , because my Lords will know , my Lords , that the origin of the Hindu Marriage Act , the Hindu Code , did something that was not permitted in sacramental Hindu law , which is inter-caste marriage , in -- sagotra marriage , divorce , inheritance ... Dr. Guruswamy , but there's there 's also … there may be some amount of sage wisdom in also going about our interpretative task in an incremental manner because otherwise , do we then confine ourselves only to the Hindu Marriage Act ? What about the Parsi Marriage Act ? What about the Muslim law ? What about the Jews ? What about the Buddhists ? A lot of other communities . Therefore , perhaps one option for the court because … the Constitution itself and the law is itself evolving . So the court has to be mindful of the fact that we are doing by process of interpretation what you are calling upon us to do . So there may be some element of judicial discretion in perhaps going incrementally , covering a canvas for the present , which would substantially then ... assuming that even there you are right , because you have to hear the other side , confine yourself to this incremental canvas and then allow society to evolve . Allow Parliament's Parliament 's perceptions to evolve over a period of time because Parliament is also responding to the evolution of society over a period of time . We can't ca n't deny the fact that there is undoubtedly the legislative element also involved , which is why the states , the Parliament , despite … having regard to that , we need to balance out various facets . So this might be perhaps one way forward . The only thing I'll I 'll say to this ... So we don't do n't have to decide everything , to decide something in this case . No , no , my Lords , I follow , I follow . The only thing ... Yes , my Lord ? One is the channel pointed out by Mr. Rohatgi in a restrictive sense that only construe the Special Marriage Act . If it founds favor with us , it'll it 'll give us the status of marriage . If it does not , he rightly said , you are out . Therefore if other issues at all arise or don't do n't arise , will depend on how we interpret this aspect . Other issues will survive for another day . Or may not survive for the time being for another day , depending on what view we take on this core issue . And in the wisdom , as the Chief Justice said , sometimes incremental changes in issues of social and societal ramifications are possibly a better course . There is a time for everything ... there is time for some things to come . Therefore , what was being suggested was , uh , can we , for the time being , confine it only to this limited issue ? Don't Do n't step into … let me complete … don't do n't step into Personal Law issues under different religious norms . Don't Do n't get into any of those issues , but only say that , can the Special Marriage Act be interpreted in a manner by reading into it a general gender - neutral situation , period . Can I say , and perhaps you can then help us , you can assist us . And we'll we 'll ask the Solicitor also to assist us on how we can sort of develop the notion of a civil union which really finds recognition in our statute , namely the Special Marriage Act , you see , because now , for instance , you know , I'm I 'm sure you wouldn't would n't also deny the fact that between the time that Navtej was delivered and today , our society has found much greater acceptance , say , of same - sex relationships for the last five years that we have seen it unfold . And that's that 's very positive because , you know , you find that there is a greater acceptance and acceptance in our universities . And by the way , our universities don't do n't consist of only urban kids ; they also come from the smaller , smaller areas . Yes , but there is this acceptance which is evolving . So , you know , in this evolving consensus , the court is also playing a dialogical role to create that consensus and move towards a more equal future by being conscious of our own limitations , which you can't ca n't deny the legislative arena . The only request I would make is that the question may be left open to be adjudicated . Obviously , we're we 're not going to reject what we don't do n't . We can always confine our canvas and then not reject . Yes , obviously not . And that is not necessary for the court to do at all . The second point is simply this , that marriage is not only as if that were not … But leave broader and broader issues for an evolving future . Yes , but marriage is not only a question of dignity , as if that were not enough . It is also a bouquet of rights that LGBTQ people are being denied post - Johar , right ? Those rights are simple things : bank accounts , life insurance , medical insurance . I for instance , frankly … Rental accommodation ... I can not buy SCBA medical insurance . I am a member of the SCBA Bar . I can not buy my family medical insurance from the SCBA . So this is the reality of how rights are exercised . Rights are exercised when you are able to protect your relationships . One facet of that right is the constitutional value of dignity , equality , fraternity . The other facet of that right is the day to day business of life , and the day to day business of life is all of those things . Now when we look at law in India — and all common law is premised like this — that most rights flow from this notion of blood relationships , i.e. , either being born into the family or being married .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",
            "|GUM_fiction_lunre.txt |Chapter Two : Master Lunre My father’s father ’s actions were largely incomprehensible to me , guided by his own secret and labyrinthine calculations . He dwelt in another world , a world of intrigue , bargains , contracts and clandestine purchases of land all over the island . He was in many ways a world in himself , whole as a sphere . No doubt his decisions were perfectly logical in his own eyes — even the one that prompted him , a patriotic islander , to bring me a tutor from Bain : Master Lunre , an Olondrian . The day began as it usually did when my father was expected home from his travels , the house festooned with flowers and stocked with coconut liquor . We stood by the gate , washed and perfumed and arrayed in our brightest clothes , my mother twisting her hands in her skirt , my father’s father ’s wife with red eyes . Jom , grown taller and broad in the shoulders , moaned gently to himself , while I stood nervously rubbing the heel of one sandal on the flagstones . We scanned the deep blue valley for the first sign of the company , but before we saw them we heard the children shouting : “ A yellow man ! ” A yellow man ! We glanced at one another in confusion . My mother bit her lower lip ; Jom gave a groan of alarm . At first I thought the children meant my father , whose golden skin , the color of the night - monkey’s monkey ’s pelt , was a rarity in the islands ; but certainly the children of Tyom were familiar with my father , and would never have greeted a council - member with such ill - mannered yells . Then I remembered the only “ yellow man ” I had ever seen , an Olondrian wizard and doctor who had visited Tyom in my childhood , who wore two pieces of glass on his eyes , attached to his ears with wires , and roamed the hills of Tinimavet , cutting bits off the trees . I have since learned that that doctor wrote a well - received treatise , On the Medicinal Properties of the Juice of the Young Coconut , and died a respected man in his native city of Deinivel ; but at the time I felt certain he had returned with his sack of tree - cuttings . “ There they are , ” said Pavit , the head house - servant , in a strained voice . And there they were : a chain of riders weaving among the trees . My father’s father ’s plaited umbrella appeared , his still , imposing figure , and beside him another man appeared , tall and lean , astride an island mule . The hectic screams of the children preceded the company into the village , so that they advanced like a festival , drawing people out of their houses . As they approached I saw that my father’s father ’s face was shining with pride , and his bearing had in it a new hauteur , like that of the old island kings . The man who rode beside him , looking uncomfortable with his long legs , kept his gaze lowered and fixed between the ears of his plodding mule . He was not yellow , but very pale brown , the color of raw cashews ; he had silver hair , worn cropped close to the skull so that it resembled a cap . He was not the leaf - collecting doctor , but an altogether strange man , with silver eyebrows in his smooth face and long fine - knuckled hands . As he dismounted in front of the house I heard my mother whispering : “ Protect us , God with the Black - and - White Tail , from that which is not of this earth . ” My father dismounted from his mule and strutted toward us , grinning . I thought I caught an odor off him , of fish , sea - sickness and sweat . We knelt and stared down at the bald ground , murmuring ritual greetings , until he touched the tops of our heads with the palm of his fleshy hand . Then we stood , unable to keep from staring at the stranger , who faced us awkwardly , half - smiling , taller than any man there .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n",

I had buried my husband in a lead box sunk into the mud of the bottom of the river , where all the riverboatmen lie . And after the war , I had buried my children , all four , in white linen shrouds in the new graveyards plowed into what used to be our farmland : all the land stretching from the river delta to the hills . I had one granddaughter who survived the war . I saw her sometimes : in a bright pink dress , a sparkling drink in her hand , on the arm of some foreign officer with brocade on his shoulders , at the edge of a marble patio . She never looked back at me — poverty and failure and political disrepute being all , these days , contagious and synonymous . The young were mostly dead , and the old men had been taken away , they told us , to learn important new things and to come back when they were ready to contribute fully . So it was a city of grandmothers . And it was in a grandmother bar by the waterfront — sipping hot tea with rum and watching over the shoulders of dockworkers playing mah - jongg — that I first heard of the valley of giants . We all laughed at the idea , except for a chemist with a crooked nose and rouge caked in the creases of her face , who was incensed . “ We live in the modern era ! ” she cried . “ You should be ashamed of yourself ! \" The traveler stood up from the table . She was bony and rough - skinned and bent like an old crow , with a blue silk scarf and hanks of hair as black as soot . Her eyes were veined with red . “ Nonetheless , ” the traveler said , and she walked out . They were laughing at the chemist as well as at the traveler . To find anyone still proud , anyone who believed in giants or shame , was hilarious . The air of the bar was acrid with triumph . Finding someone even more vulnerable and foolish than we were , after everything had been taken from us — that was a delight . But I followed the traveler , into the wet streets . The smell of fish oozed from the docks . Here and there were bits of charred debris in the gutters . I caught her at her door . She invited me in for tea and massage . Her limbs were weathered and ringed , like the branches of trees in the dry country . She smelled like honey that has been kept a while in a dark room , a little fermented . A heady smell . In the morning , brilliant sunlight scoured the walls and the floor , and the traveler and her pack were gone . I hurried home . My house had survived the war with all its brown clay walls intact , though the garden and the courtyard were a heap of blackened rubble . My house was empty and cold . I packed six loaves of flatbread , some olives , a hard cheese , one nice dress , walking clothes , my pills and glasses , a jug of wine , a can-teen of water , and a kitchen knife . I sat in the shadow in my living room for a while , looking at the amorphous mass of the blanket I had been crocheting . That granddaughter : her parents both worked in the vineyards , and when she was a child , she would play in my courtyard in the after - noons . When she scraped her knees bloody on the stones , she refused to cry . She would cry from frustration when the older children could do something that she couldn\\'t could n\\'t — like tie knots , or catch a chicken .', 'entities': []}\n",

            " {'text': \"It is my special pleasure to address the fifty - ninth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations . This universal forum has enabled the peoples of the world to coordinate and harmonize their efforts in preserving peace and security , in achieving prosperity and upholding the values of human civilization . I would like to congratulate you , Mr. President , on being elected to preside over this august body and to express my confidence in your successful leadership . I would also like , on behalf of Albania , to convey to the Secretary - General our highest appreciation for his leading contribution to the fulfilment of the historical mission of the United Nations and to the aspirations of our peoples for a better world in which only peace , democracy and economic prosperity reign . This session of the General Assembly takes place in a milestone year for Europe . Only a few months ago , a historic event vitalized the dream of a more united and stronger Europe . Ten European countries , sharing a common aspiration for integration , were admitted into the European Union . The Albanian Government and society are engaged in an all - round European integration process , and they are carrying out necessary reforms with the necessary political will and drive . Albania is working to strengthen the democratic institutions and capacities of its central and local government with a view to bringing its legislation and conditions into line with European Union standards , progressively achieving concrete and measurable results , as previously defined . Determined to make our contribution to regional and global security , the Albanian Government considers the country's country 's integration into NATO to be one of its major objectives . The NATO Istanbul Summit last June commended the progress made by my country in this regard and encouraged the deepening of reforms . It welcomed Albania's Albania 's contribution to regional stability and cooperation and committed to assess our further progress at the next NATO summit , which would hopefully mark the start of negotiations for our full membership in the alliance . We believe that the commitments set up in the framework of the Adriatic Charter are also contributing to meet NATO standards , to the benefit of regional stability and security . We remain truly convinced that the respect and protection of human rights and freedoms are the main pillars of a pluralist democratic society . The Government of the Republic of Albania will continue to constantly demonstrate its commitment to a full implementation of the standards enshrined in the United Nations and Council of Europe conventions , as well as the relevant documents of regional organizations , such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , in which we are playing a very active role . We will continue to do so in the future as well . By adopting contemporary legislation and by becoming a party to other recently adopted international instruments on human rights , Albania has associated itself with countries that are enforcing a number of national strategies and programmes focusing on specific population groups , especially women , children , persons in need and minorities , among others . In recent years , the Albanian Government has started to periodically submit reports to the committees of the six main United Nations human rights treaties and is taking their recommendations into serious consideration . It is our belief that these international mechanisms play a significant and important role as guardians of the common human values we have together adopted . Albania , as one of the 191 signatory countries of the Millennium Declaration , remains fully committed to implementation of the Millennium Development Goals , which have been properly reflected in a national strategy for social and economic development . The pattern of our sustained economic growth , which is at 6 to 7 per cent for the seventh consecutive year , is a good support base for the whole society to maintain higher standards of respect for human rights and to fight poverty and crime . I would like to take this opportunity to thank the United Nations specialized agencies for their valuable assistance in support of the implementation of these objectives nationwide and on a central and local level . The Albanian Government is pleased to note that an ever - healthier climate of confidence and relations of bilateral and multilateral cooperation are prevailing in the South - Eastern European region . The countries of the region are fully engaged in a process that will lead us clearly toward Euro - Atlantic integration and at the same time continually remove us from the extremist tendencies that caused a number of conflicts in the last decade . The regional policy of my Government is guided by the motto : ' the more integrated in the region , the more integrated in Europe . ' In implementing this policy , Albania is cooperating as never before with all the countries of the region by making borders less relevant , opening up to one regional market the implementation of free trade agreements and free movement corridors , and stimulating foreign direct investment . We are especially cooperating with the common fight against organized crime and all kinds of illegal trafficking . In the meantime , Albania is reinforcing its border management and control , guided by the European Union and NATO standards . My country will hold general parliamentary elections by the middle of next year . We are committed to doing all that is required to ensure that the election process is fully compatible with international standards for free and fair elections . To that end , we are committed to continuing to work with relevant specialized institutions on elections by fully implementing especially OSCE / Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights ( ODIHR ) recommendations . For us , the process and standards are more important than the results of the elections . In the context of strengthening regional cooperation , my country is committed to a more enhanced partnership with all regional organizations and initiatives that serve the promotion of good neighbourly relations ; the strengthening of regional peace , security and stability ; ensuring political support for integration into Euro - Atlantic structures , and attracting financing for national and regional projects in priority fields such as energy , transportation and telecommunications . On its path towards European integration , the South - East European region is still facing pending challenges , such as the future of Kosovo . Albania greatly appreciates the recent democratic and integration developments in Kosovo , thanks to the efforts of the respective peoples and the partnership of its self - governing institutions with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo ( UNMIK ) . Allow me at this point to congratulate Mr. Soren Jessen - Petersen , Special Representative for Kosovo of the United Nations Secretary - General , in assuming this very important duty .\", 'entities': []}\n"

I had buried my husband in a lead box sunk into the mud of the bottom of the river , where all the riverboatmen lie . And after the war , I had buried my children , all four , in white linen shrouds in the new graveyards plowed into what used to be our farmland : all the land stretching from the river delta to the hills . I had one granddaughter who survived the war . I saw her sometimes : in a bright pink dress , a sparkling drink in her hand , on the arm of some foreign officer with brocade on his shoulders , at the edge of a marble patio . She never looked back at me — poverty and failure and political disrepute being all , these days , contagious and synonymous . The young were mostly dead , and the old men had been taken away , they told us , to learn important new things and to come back when they were ready to contribute fully . So it was a city of grandmothers . And it was in a grandmother bar by the waterfront — sipping hot tea with rum and watching over the shoulders of dockworkers playing mah - jongg — that I first heard of the valley of giants . We all laughed at the idea , except for a chemist with a crooked nose and rouge caked in the creases of her face , who was incensed . “ We live in the modern era ! ” she cried . “ You should be ashamed of yourself ! \" The traveler stood up from the table . She was bony and rough - skinned and bent like an old crow , with a blue silk scarf and hanks of hair as black as soot . Her eyes were veined with red . “ Nonetheless , ” the traveler said , and she walked out . They were laughing at the chemist as well as at the traveler . To find anyone still proud , anyone who believed in giants or shame , was hilarious . The air of the bar was acrid with triumph . Finding someone even more vulnerable and foolish than we were , after everything had been taken from us — that was a delight . But I followed the traveler , into the wet streets . The smell of fish oozed from the docks . Here and there were bits of charred debris in the gutters . I caught her at her door . She invited me in for tea and massage . Her limbs were weathered and ringed , like the branches of trees in the dry country . She smelled like honey that has been kept a while in a dark room , a little fermented . A heady smell . In the morning , brilliant sunlight scoured the walls and the floor , and the traveler and her pack were gone . I hurried home . My house had survived the war with all its brown clay walls intact , though the garden and the courtyard were a heap of blackened rubble . My house was empty and cold . I packed six loaves of flatbread , some olives , a hard cheese , one nice dress , walking clothes , my pills and glasses , a jug of wine , a can-teen of water , and a kitchen knife . I sat in the shadow in my living room for a while , looking at the amorphous mass of the blanket I had been crocheting . That granddaughter : her parents both worked in the vineyards , and when she was a child , she would play in my courtyard in the after - noons . When she scraped her knees bloody on the stones , she refused to cry . She would cry from frustration when the older children could do something that she couldn\\'t could n\\'t — like tie knots , or catch a chicken .', 'entities': [(14, 20, 'ORG'), (272, 276, 'CARDINAL'), (433, 436, 'CARDINAL'), (738, 748, 'DATE'), (1139, 1144, 'ORDINAL'), (2380, 2391, 'TIME'), (2684, 2687, 'CARDINAL'), (2740, 2743, 'CARDINAL'), (3031, 3040, 'LOC')]}\n",

            " {'text': \"It is my special pleasure to address the fifty - ninth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations . This universal forum has enabled the peoples of the world to coordinate and harmonize their efforts in preserving peace and security , in achieving prosperity and upholding the values of human civilization . I would like to congratulate you , Mr. President , on being elected to preside over this august body and to express my confidence in your successful leadership . I would also like , on behalf of Albania , to convey to the Secretary - General our highest appreciation for his leading contribution to the fulfilment of the historical mission of the United Nations and to the aspirations of our peoples for a better world in which only peace , democracy and economic prosperity reign . This session of the General Assembly takes place in a milestone year for Europe . Only a few months ago , a historic event vitalized the dream of a more united and stronger Europe . Ten European countries , sharing a common aspiration for integration , were admitted into the European Union . The Albanian Government and society are engaged in an all - round European integration process , and they are carrying out necessary reforms with the necessary political will and drive . Albania is working to strengthen the democratic institutions and capacities of its central and local government with a view to bringing its legislation and conditions into line with European Union standards , progressively achieving concrete and measurable results , as previously defined . Determined to make our contribution to regional and global security , the Albanian Government considers the country's country 's integration into NATO to be one of its major objectives . The NATO Istanbul Summit last June commended the progress made by my country in this regard and encouraged the deepening of reforms . It welcomed Albania's Albania 's contribution to regional stability and cooperation and committed to assess our further progress at the next NATO summit , which would hopefully mark the start of negotiations for our full membership in the alliance . We believe that the commitments set up in the framework of the Adriatic Charter are also contributing to meet NATO standards , to the benefit of regional stability and security . We remain truly convinced that the respect and protection of human rights and freedoms are the main pillars of a pluralist democratic society . The Government of the Republic of Albania will continue to constantly demonstrate its commitment to a full implementation of the standards enshrined in the United Nations and Council of Europe conventions , as well as the relevant documents of regional organizations , such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , in which we are playing a very active role . We will continue to do so in the future as well . By adopting contemporary legislation and by becoming a party to other recently adopted international instruments on human rights , Albania has associated itself with countries that are enforcing a number of national strategies and programmes focusing on specific population groups , especially women , children , persons in need and minorities , among others . In recent years , the Albanian Government has started to periodically submit reports to the committees of the six main United Nations human rights treaties and is taking their recommendations into serious consideration . It is our belief that these international mechanisms play a significant and important role as guardians of the common human values we have together adopted . Albania , as one of the 191 signatory countries of the Millennium Declaration , remains fully committed to implementation of the Millennium Development Goals , which have been properly reflected in a national strategy for social and economic development . The pattern of our sustained economic growth , which is at 6 to 7 per cent for the seventh consecutive year , is a good support base for the whole society to maintain higher standards of respect for human rights and to fight poverty and crime . I would like to take this opportunity to thank the United Nations specialized agencies for their valuable assistance in support of the implementation of these objectives nationwide and on a central and local level . The Albanian Government is pleased to note that an ever - healthier climate of confidence and relations of bilateral and multilateral cooperation are prevailing in the South - Eastern European region . The countries of the region are fully engaged in a process that will lead us clearly toward Euro - Atlantic integration and at the same time continually remove us from the extremist tendencies that caused a number of conflicts in the last decade . The regional policy of my Government is guided by the motto : ' the more integrated in the region , the more integrated in Europe . ' In implementing this policy , Albania is cooperating as never before with all the countries of the region by making borders less relevant , opening up to one regional market the implementation of free trade agreements and free movement corridors , and stimulating foreign direct investment . We are especially cooperating with the common fight against organized crime and all kinds of illegal trafficking . In the meantime , Albania is reinforcing its border management and control , guided by the European Union and NATO standards . My country will hold general parliamentary elections by the middle of next year . We are committed to doing all that is required to ensure that the election process is fully compatible with international standards for free and fair elections . To that end , we are committed to continuing to work with relevant specialized institutions on elections by fully implementing especially OSCE / Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights ( ODIHR ) recommendations . For us , the process and standards are more important than the results of the elections . In the context of strengthening regional cooperation , my country is committed to a more enhanced partnership with all regional organizations and initiatives that serve the promotion of good neighbourly relations ; the strengthening of regional peace , security and stability ; ensuring political support for integration into Euro - Atlantic structures , and attracting financing for national and regional projects in priority fields such as energy , transportation and telecommunications . On its path towards European integration , the South - East European region is still facing pending challenges , such as the future of Kosovo . Albania greatly appreciates the recent democratic and integration developments in Kosovo , thanks to the efforts of the respective peoples and the partnership of its self - governing institutions with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo ( UNMIK ) . Allow me at this point to congratulate Mr. Soren Jessen - Petersen , Special Representative for Kosovo of the United Nations Secretary - General , in assuming this very important duty .\", 'entities': [(41, 54, 'DATE'), (66, 108, 'ORG'), (403, 414, 'DATE'), (514, 521, 'GPE'), (662, 680, 'ORG'), (818, 838, 'ORG'), (854, 870, 'DATE'), (875, 881, 'LOC'), (884, 905, 'DATE'), (975, 981, 'LOC'), (984, 987, 'CARDINAL'), (988, 996, 'NORP'), (1074, 1092, 'ORG'), (1095, 1118, 'ORG'), (1161, 1169, 'NORP'), (1282, 1289, 'GPE'), (1464, 1478, 'ORG'), (1643, 1666, 'ORG'), (1719, 1723, 'ORG'), (1760, 1784, 'ORG'), (1785, 1794, 'DATE'), (1906, 1913, 'GPE'), (1916, 1923, 'GPE'), (2035, 2039, 'ORG'), (2254, 2258, 'ORG'), (2467, 2508, 'ORG'), (2619, 2637, 'ORG'), (2642, 2659, 'ORG'), (2744, 2789, 'ORG'), (2793, 2799, 'LOC'), (3028, 3035, 'GPE'), (3261, 3273, 'DATE'), (3276, 3299, 'ORG'), (3368, 3371, 'CARDINAL'), (3377, 3391, 'ORG'), (3637, 3644, 'GPE'), (3650, 3653, 'CARDINAL'), (3661, 3664, 'CARDINAL'), (3688, 3714, 'EVENT'), (3762, 3794, 'ORG'), (3952, 3958, 'CARDINAL'), (3972, 4000, 'DATE'), (4189, 4203, 'ORG'), (4354, 4377, 'ORG'), (4518, 4546, 'LOC'), (4648, 4663, 'ORG'), (4786, 4801, 'DATE'), (4927, 4933, 'LOC'), (4968, 4975, 'GPE'), (5092, 5095, 'CARDINAL'), (5363, 5370, 'GPE'), (5432, 5450, 'ORG'), (5455, 5459, 'ORG'), (5528, 5551, 'DATE'), (5854, 5912, 'ORG'), (5915, 5920, 'ORG'), (6357, 6372, 'ORG'), (6542, 6550, 'NORP'), (6569, 6581, 'LOC'), (6582, 6590, 'NORP'), (6657, 6663, 'GPE'), (6666, 6673, 'GPE'), (6748, 6754, 'GPE'), (6867, 6916, 'ORG'), (6920, 6926, 'GPE'), (6982, 7005, 'PERSON'), (7035, 7041, 'GPE'), (7049, 7063, 'ORG')]}\n"
